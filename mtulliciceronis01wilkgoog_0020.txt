had become almost desperate, when a revolution in the
state of affairs at Rome brought him in a moment un

expected assistance in his great difficulties.

’ 8. Afterthe departure of Sulla the Marianpart‘yhad
again got the upper hand in Rome. Sulla was deposed
from his command, and the consul 01 the year 86, L.
Valerius Flaccus, was commissioned to carry on the war

η against Mithridates 111 his place. But as Flaccus was no
general, a skilful and experienced· soldier, O. Flavius
Fimbria⁹⁹, was sent with him as his lieutenant. By 1115
severity and avarice Flaccus made himself so hated by
the two legions which composed his army, that a divi·
sion, sent on in advance into Thessaly, went over into
Sulla’s camp, and it was only with the help 01 the more
popular Fimbria that he succeeded in keeping the rest
01 his troops from deserting. When they had crossed
over into Asia, the lieutenant, a man capable of any
crime—he had served his apprenticeship as a satellite
01 Marius—made use of the feeling in the army to
seize the command 101· himself, after falling upon and
killing the consul in Nicomedia⁹³. The Senate winked
at the offence, and confirmed the murderer of his own
general in 1115 command ⁹⁴. Fimbria, having been thus
put at the head 01 the army, inflicted several defeats
upon the son of Mithridates, who bore the same name⁹⁵,
and marched to Pergamum, the capital of the Pontic
king since 1115 victory over Aquillius, where he nearly
succeeded in getting the king himself into his power'⁶.
