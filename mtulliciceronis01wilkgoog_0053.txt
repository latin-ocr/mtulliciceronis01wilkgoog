tor’s special aim, the discussion of these two divisions
was certainly not out of place. It was intended to
carry the conviction that· the war in question was
one, on the success of which the welfare of the state
depended‚ and that therefore the choice of a com-
mander required all the greater care.-

40. The orator thus gained a firmer basis for the
argument of the third part, in which the general state-
ment ¹⁰⁹ of the qualities required by a great general is
followed by the proof that Pompeius unites in himself
,all these qualities in the highest degree¹¹⁰. This part
of his speech Cicero has executed with great art, and
also with a certain moderation in his panegyric, which
is shown by the calmness of its tone. His ability comes
out conspicuously in the passages in which he speaks
of the success of Pompeius in the war with the pirates,
and his noble moderatiori in victory, and also where he
points out that the position of the Asiatic provinces
requires the appointment of one who knows how to be
not merely a soldier, but also a man, it· these severely
tried ·countries are not to be utterly ruined. We
might have expected from the skill of the orator that
he would not fail to employ in favour of Pompeius the
fortunate circumstance that he was at the very time

military discipline had disappeared, and the honour of the
Roman arms was imperilled. A victim of mutiny and jealousy,
to which a stronger man indeed would not have succumbed,
Lucullus returned to Rome? 1⁰⁹) See Halm’ s note on
pro Rosc. 1562. ¹1⁰) Pmcisely the same kind of argu-
ment is put by Dio, xxxvr. 10, into the mouth 01 Gabinius,
- when he 1s making a speech in support 01 his rogation on the

wars with the pirates. -
