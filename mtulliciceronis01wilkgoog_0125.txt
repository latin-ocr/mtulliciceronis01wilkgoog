ς 62. duo consules. Mamercus Aemilius Lepidus, and D.
J unius Brutus, 13.c. 77, [who had, however, declined to take,
the command against Sertorius: cp. Mommsen 1v. 261.

ut, [wanting in the MSS. but supplied by Fleckeisen.
Eberhard inserts it after quam]: for the position of ut cp.
pro Flacc. 5 65, quid in semwne Graeco tam tritum atquc
celebratum est quam, si quis despicatui ducitur, ut Mysorum
ultimus esse dicatur?

1.. Marcius Philippus, consul in Β. c. 91, censor 86, a
zealous partisan of Sulla, and hence a great supportet of
Pompeius, known as an orator for his readiness in debate
and his biting wit: cp. Brut. 173, in altercando cum aliquo

ullum alium. According to Mommsen (Rom. Staatsr.² 1.
549 ᾖ), these words are to be understood literally: ior as the
earliest age at which the consulship was attainable was 43,
