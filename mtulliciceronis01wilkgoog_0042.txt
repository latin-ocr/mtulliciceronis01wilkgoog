ot* it, the passing of the law of the praetor L. Aurelius
Cotta, which removed the law-courts from the exclusive
control of the senatorial order. At the close ,οἱ his
consulship Pompeius refused the government of a
province and waited in Rome, until an opportunity
should be offered for him to play an extraordinary
part. ,

disturbances of the pirates, which at that time had
reached an unheamd-of height. For twenty years the
sea had been rendered unsafe by these curses of human
society ⁸⁵. The Romans had repeatedly sent out fleets

and armies to annihilate the pirates ς and the great
successes which P. Servilius Vatia won in his three

years' campaign, 7 8-7 5, warranted the hope that the
back of the evil had been broken: but shortly after his
return it broke out afresh with still greater violence,
so that Rome was compelled to have recourse to extra-
ordinary measures. But this time a mistake was
made in the choice of the commender: M, Antonius,
the son of the orator and father ,of the triumvir, who
was sent out in 7 4 with the most extensive powerS,
earned nothing from his unlimited imperium but shame
and disgrace. The evil was inoreased by the renewal
ot· the war with Mithridates ς for the disper-sion of his
fleets brought to the pirates swarms of fresh freebooterS.

⁸⁵) Thus Cicero Verr. v. 7 6 calls the pirates communes hostes
nentium nationumque omnium. Cp. ς 44 os this speech: com·
mune omnium gentium bellum, and 585, quo bello omnes aemes
ac nationes premebamur.
