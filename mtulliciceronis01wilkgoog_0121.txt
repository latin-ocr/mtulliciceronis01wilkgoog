ΟΡ. Marquardt Rom. Staatsv. 1. 386. Pompeius had received
the privilege of nominating his own leyati for the war against
the pirates3 but he was prevented from appointing Gabinius,
not merely by a regard 10 1113 circumstances generally, but
also by the lex Licinia et Aebutia, which ordained that if any
one brought forward a proposal with regard to any potestas 01·
curatio, neither he himself, nor his colleagues, nor his relations
could be enti-usted with it: and this naturally included also
the right of holding any subordinate office in connexion with

xxm. 7 tells us that Gabinius was actually exposed to personal
danger in bringing forward his proposal 2 ‘ the senate preferred
to endure anything at the hands of the pirates, rather than
to put such power into his hands, and they very nearly killed
Gabinius in the senate-house itself.’ ΟΡ. Μο1111113311 1v. 10⁷.
