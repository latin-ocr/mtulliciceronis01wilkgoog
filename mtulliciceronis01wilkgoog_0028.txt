in his favour, brought the whole land under his power Ι
in the course of the year 72. But it took two full
years more before all the towns were capturedffl. At
Cabira, we are told, as the baggage was being sent
away from the enemy’s camp, 'when flight was deter-
mined upon, = the king himself was very nearly taken
prisoner. Lucullus had indeed, in his desire to cut off
the way of escape from the fleeing foe, given strict
orders to strike down every one, before proceeding to
plunder: but when his men saw -the heaps - of gold
and silver vessels and valuable robes· that were flung
aside in the crush to get out of the camp, his ,orders
were forgotten, and plundering became general. Some
soldiers, who had got up to Mithridates himself,

besides, such as Eupatoria, Heraclea, and Themiscyra were
only taken after an obstinate resistance. For details as to
the conquest oi the country see Mommsen, 1v. 59 ff.

whom Plutarch Lucull. 18 on the whole agrees: the latter
- gives the following sketch of the actual escape of the king:
⁶ 'the horse which carried the king was already within
resch of his pursuem, but as one of the mules which was
carrying the gold, either came in between them and the
king by accident, or was placed by the order oi the king
between him and his pursuers, they seized and plundered the
gold, and then falling out among themselves missod their
prize.' The account of Memnon, c. 44, which is somewhat
