he believed, as he himself expressly says, that, in view
of the manifest favour which the people had shown
him hitherto in electing him to one office after an-

in him, by thrcwing into the scale the great weight of
his expressed opinion, in his high position as prae-

⁶ tor. He wished in this way to discharge to the people

the tribute of his gratitude by meeting their wishes in
a question which excited so much interest3 so that we
may well believe his assurances that he had not been
influenced by any special requests on the part of Pom-
peius or his friends in Rome¹⁰⁹ to contribute his share-
also to his glorification. But it is hard to determine
whether he was entirely free from any notion of per-
sonal advantage with· respect to his own future canvass
for the consulship ¹⁰⁸, or whether he felt so sure already
of the favour of the people that he ventui-ed to expect
from them alone his advancement to the highest ho-
nours. Appearances speak for the former, while his
emphatic recommendation of the popular favourite be—
trays also the secondary desigu of securin his own
influence with the people. “
