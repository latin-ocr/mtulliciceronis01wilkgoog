king still retained in his possession some portions of
Cappadocia. The latter had withdrawn to his own·
kingdom and reduced to submission the Colchians and·
Bosporans who were wavering in their allegiance⁸⁶t to*
this end he had created a new navyand levied such large
forces, that it was soon said that such preparations were'
not directed against the Bosporans‚ but against 'a more
dangerous enemy, the Romans ⁸⁷. However, he did
not oppose any armed resistance to the inroads and·
pillagings of Murena, but sent envoys to Rome to
complain of the proceedings of the lieutenant. But
as Murena paid no attention even to the orders of the·
Senate to avoid all hostilities, but on the contrary
pushed forward as far as the Halys in a new campaign of-
plunder, Mithridates gave him a severe defeat ⁸⁸, and
compelled him to retreat into Phrygia. Fui-ther
’ hostilities were avoided ' by the arrival of Aulus
Gabinius, who brought to Murena SulIa's commands·
umam from an hostilitas against Mithridates and
to effect a reconciliation between him and Ariobar-
zanes. Thus ended the second Mithridatio war. ²
Murena, though he had only carried off undefended
booty, and had gained no real victory over the enemy,

‚ „ was allowed the honour of a triumph, which he cele·

brated in 13.c. 80.

²⁶) ἀφισταμένους, App. 1. c. ³7) Appian says: ‘ for
his campaign against the Bosporans he built ships and
collected a large army, so that the magnitude of his prepara-
tions quickly excited a suspicion that all this was collected,
not against the Bosporum, but against the Romans!
²⁸) App.65. Memnon, c. 36, gives adifferent account, represent-
ing 1110 battle between Mithridates and Murena as indecisive,
and asserting that both sides retreated.
