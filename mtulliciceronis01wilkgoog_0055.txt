who had maintained that no innovatione must be
introduced against the principles and regulations of
their ancestors. This patriot certainly had not failed>
to see that extraordinary circumstances required for the
time extraordinary measures: but previously, when
opposing the Gabinian law, he had referred to the
instances of Marius and Sulla¹²⁵² as showing how
ruinous repeated violations of the constitution. had
proved to be. Now how does Cicero meet the fresh
warning, to keep at last to the path of the constitu·
tion'l He shows in the case of Marius· himself, and
also of PompeiuS, that the rule of their ancestors had
already been frequently departed from, and hence that
there was nothing surprising in a new deviation from
it. Such sophistry would necessarily excite our indig-
nation, if it had not at any rate a rhetorical ground of
excuse. The enumeration of the innovations, which
had been introduced in the person of Pompeius, was

intended to awaken in the people the belief that ’

Pompeius was an altogether extraordinary personage ¹¹³,
who by his greatness threw all other men into the
shade. For if the Roman state had had others like
him, the senate or the people would not so frequently
have entrusted *important commands and extraordinary

powers to one and the same man.
